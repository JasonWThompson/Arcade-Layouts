# Arcade-Layouts

These are controller layouts that fit my arcade system. This modular system allows for three kinds of layouts:

* 5.5" Half Modules
* 11" Full Modules
* 22" Double Modules

A half module consists of half of a controller. An example might be an 8-way with 1 or 2 player buttons. Another example might be a six button layout. Two half modules make an entire controller.

A full module consists of a complete controller. This might be something like a hitbox where splitting it in two makes the controller less usable.

A double module is for exotic layouts. It might be something like a four player layout.

To cut out a module, cut out the black traces. The smallest holes are for screwing the module into the arcade itself. The medium size hole are for small arcade buttons. The larger holes are for standard sized arcade buttons. The red out lines should not be cut and are there to visually see how the fully assembled button will look with the rest of the controller.
